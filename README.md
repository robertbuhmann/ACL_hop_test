# ACL_hop_test
This repository contains the data (acl_clinical_tests_de-identified.csv) and script files (Analysis.R; bootstrap.R) used to conduct the statistical analysis of the data for the published version of this project. The analysis begins from the .csv file (any data processing is described in the script). The "Analysis.R" file is used to calcualte correlations between variables, run multiple linear regression and logistic regression models, and calcualte model error by predicting knee extension strength of the study cohort. This script also contains the necessary code to reproduce figures in the final manuscript. The "bootstrap.R" file is used to calculate the confidence intervals around correlation coefficients using bootstrapping.
